# LtMvpWebApp

This application is the first MVP created for testing the idea
of developing an app for training LÃ¼ckentext tests specially created
for foreign students willing to enroll to a university in Germany.

The objective of the MVP is to test the following hypotheses:

 - students want to know when they fail to fill a right answer
 - students want to see an explanation of why they fail
 - students need extended help for training German grammatical rules,
   as to help them learn specifically the rules they do not master and
   dynamically.
